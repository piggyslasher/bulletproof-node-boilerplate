# Create Node App

Boilerplate to get you started with creating a nodejs app

The boilerplate is meant to be lean, and functional. No tie-up with any plugins like Express and the likes. It's a barebones `Node` app with live-reload, testing, test-coverage and a simple TravisCI build.

- [ ] use `create-new-cli` to provision node app
- [ ] perform live-reload of all scripts using nodemon
- [ ] provide testing using Jest
- [ ] provide TravisCI basic testing
- [ ] provide codacy stats
- [ ] provide code coverage
- [ ] provide sane linting rules (currently based on Airbnb but allows goodies like dangling commas and semi-colon free development)
- [ ] allow options for 3rd party linting rules (standard, airbnb)
